# SHITTY JUKEBOX IS NOW IN ITS OWN REPO  
- ShittyJUKEBOX REPO NOW OFFICIAL BABYYYY
- Current Version V3 

## FEATURES

- 8 emo/rock songs (with 2 included metallica songs)
- 8 Nightcore songs from early 2000s or smthg(I've been born in 2006 don't judge I wasn't even alive) 
- A jukebox ASCII Art at the bottom of code for the vibes and lyrics on the top of the code (now in an array for the nerds)
- Interactive loop (unless you fuck up pressing digits then it roasts you)
- %25 chance of getting rickrolled as you try to exit and bricks Ctrl+C 'till it is done
- Unfortunetly not uses prime numbers to determine if you want RGB or not anymore since I've learned structs
- Now apperantly it got it's own windows branch which I'll provide with .exe file too since Win users don't know what a compiler is. but it is in another repo and outdated for now (link will be at the end for the old win repo)
- WindowsPORT has it's own branch called winPORTsux which I won't merge(and since I started to C 5 days ago. That port is possible thanks to Grok(taught me what IFNDEF is))

- Now with a ASCII JUKEBOX in Genre Menu (fullscreen advised by the developer, me, yk. I'd do as I say if I were you)
- Got all the songs hard-coded since I don't trust .so and ESPECIALLY .dlls (fuk u windows)
- New features will be added 'cuz why not?
## In Development Features
- One more genre category 
- CLI music playing (tbh I don't know if I can pull this off but eventually we'll see)
- windows port(still fuk u windows I am doing it to learn. Purely pragmatistic reasons)
- Lyrics sync ups with songs(total length not word by word, I am not fucking spotify)
- Songs will be summed up to 10 + 10 songs in the new genre.
