## FEATURES

- 10emo/rock songs (with 2 included metallica songs)
- 10 Nightcore songs from early 2000s or smthg(I've been born in 2006 don't judge I wasn't even alive) 
- 10 NWOBHM songs for you to feel the speed metal/golden era in your bones (just with lyrics for now)
- A jukebox ASCII Art at the bottom of code for the vibes and lyrics on the top of the code (now in an array for the nerds)
- Interactive loop (unless you fuck up pressing digits then it roasts you)
- %25 chance of getting rickrolled as you try to exit and bricks Ctrl+C 'till it is done
- Unfortunetly not uses prime numbers to determine if you want RGB or not anymore since I've learned structs
- Now apperantly it got it's own windows branch which I'll provide with .exe file too since Win users don't know what a compiler is. but it is in another repo and outdated for now (link will be at the end for the old win repo)
- WindowsPORT has it's own branch called winPORTsux which I won't merge(and since I started to C 10 days ago. That port is possible thanks to Grok(taught me what IFNDEF is))
- Now with a ASCII JUKEBOX in Genre Menu (fullscreen advised by the developer, me, yk. I'd do as I say if I were you)
- Got all the songs hard-coded since I don't trust .so and ESPECIALLY .dlls (fuk u windows)
- New features will be added 'cuz why not?
- **3 Types of lyrics printing option**
- - RGB/Pale white choice for emo songs (and for you nerds check the peridoic sin fade...I'll make you mathgasm for sure.)
- - Forced RGB for Nightcore for obvious reasons
- - Forced Bold white for NWOBHM songs   


## In Development Features
- **Finished parts**
- - One more genre category : **DONE**  
- - Songs will be summed up to 10 + 10 songs in the new genre. **DONE** (added +1 nightcore song 18.02.2026)
- **Still in Dev**
- - CLI music playing (Well not perfect but I am cooking shit rn ngl. I left a demo. 3rd song of first playlist. My Immortal by Evanascene...jittery and cracking but even that felt like a victory at 4.56AM.) *Currently working On*

- - windows port(still fuk u windows I am doing it to learn. Purely pragmatistic reasons) Postpone a few days
- - Lyrics sync ups with songs(total length not word by word, I am not fucking spotify)


### TWEAKS (Where I brag about shit for the Nerds)

- Now it's not leaving ghost lyrics on top of the terminal (Used a cutting-edge tech called ANSI lol)
- The typing speed adjustments 
- Better exit state handling and more optimized loop
- 1 second between end of the song and genre menu to optimize reaction time on old PCs


## QA

- Q: When will that be done?
- A: Probably tomorrow if I don't sleep or next day at max.(It's been 2 days since I've said that and still working on)

- Q:Is this a malware
- A:Depends...malware for your brain but no not as a malware for computers since I don't know how to script them yet.

- Q:Do I need to install anything else
- A:For now nope...In the future -if needed- will be added in README.md

- Q: Why are you doing this to yourself?
- A:Bro you are talking to yourself in README pull yourself together.


## Compiling & Running

```bash
#To compile use:
cc/gcc ShittyJukeBox -o filename.out -lm #for math lib
#To run
./filename.o #Then have fun
```

## winPORTsux for V2 (OUTDATED AF) 
- https://github.com/neurmancer/Basic-C-Examples/tree/winPORTsux/thingsThatSupposedToBasicButOverengineeredForNothing -> In the old repo will be added to here winPORTsux branch (Which I won't merge with main since it's sucks) when V4 be ready for first Linux then I'll port it to windows
- Yes it'll have .exe I know you can't compile for shit.


## THIRD-PARTY APP NEEDS AND LICENSES WILL BE HERE I put that title to not forget and this text is to long for a title and it's self-aware
